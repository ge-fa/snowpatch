snowpatch - CI for patches [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ruscur/snowpatch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ruscur/snowpatch)
==========================

Overview
-------

snowpatch is a continuous integration tool for projects using a patch-based,
mailing-list-centric git workflow. This workflow is used by a number of
well-known open source projects such as the Linux kernel.

snowpatch serves as a bridge between a patch tracking system and a continuous
integration automation server. snowpatch monitors the patch queue for incoming
patches, applies patches on top of an existing tree, triggers appropriate
builds and test suites, and reports the results.

At present, snowpatch supports
[Patchwork](http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/) and
[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org).

snowpatch is named in honour of
[skiboot](https://github.com/open-power/skiboot), the project which inspired the
creation of snowpatch.


Installing
----------

snowpatch is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) program.  In order to compile 
it, you will need Rust and its package manager, Cargo.  snowpatch should run 
on any target that Rust compiles on, however it has only been tested on Linux.
We do not provide pre-built binaries at this stage.

### Non-Rust dependencies

* [`git`](https://git-scm.com): we try to use the
  [`git2-rs`](https://github.com/alexcrichton/git2-rs) library where
  possible, but we still need the binary for a few operations.
* [CMake](https://cmake.org)
* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) headers
* [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com) headers

### Building

snowpatch can be compiled with `cargo build --release`, which will
download and build the Rust packages we depend on. The executable can
be found in `target/release/snowpatch`.
